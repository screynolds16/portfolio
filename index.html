								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/me_final.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I attended UCSD from the Fall of 2016 to the Spring of 2020 to earn a degree in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Design and Human Computer Interaction. I competed on the Division I men's rowing team for the first 3 years of my time in San Diego, but unfortunately wasn't able to continue due to a shoulder injury. I spent my time in University seeking out ways to not only improve my technical skills in the world of software but also grow my knowledge on the more abstract subjects that surround software functionality and design</p>
								<p>I have been enthralled by programming since I took my first computer science class in highschool. I have spent the past 4 years exploring ways to build myself in all areas of software development, from the front end design and languages needed to implement it to the back end algorithms and data structures knowledge needed to implement complex software solutions</p>

								<p>As part of the software development team at Palo Alto Health Sciences, I have worked with two other software engineers on migrating the company's data and functionality over to Salesforce. Although when I entered the company in June 2020 I had no knowledge of Salesforce, I have been working hard to learn the ins and outs of developing in the Salesforce environment and making the transition as smooth as possible for my coworkers. Salesforce's Trailhead has been an amazing source for instruction on all the areas that are new for me. You can check out my progress <a href="https://trailblazer.me/id/sreynolds22">here</a>. Currently, we are working to develop Lightning Web Components to build pages and functionality using data from our company's servers as well as data stored within Salesforce. These web components are supported by api's that we have written and will mantain to support the transfer of data from our servers to Salesforce. The project will most likely be ongoing for the foreseeable future as we work to migrate current patient data onto the platform and create a useful interface for the company.</p>

								<p>With all of the free time I had available due to COVID-19 cancelations, I took the opportunity to build a website using Python, HTML, CSS, JS, Flask, and Spotify's API with my brother. The website's purpose is to take all of the songs you have "liked" on Spotify and sort them into different playlists based on genre. We then used the Flask framework to develop the algorithm into a functioning website using HTML, CSS, and JS. We host and manage the website on a Linux server.

								<p>During my time as a software development intern at Palo Alto Health Sciences I was assigned a project to develop an Android app for alumni of the Freespira treatment who wanted access to the auditory cues used during treatment to help them control their breathing. This was my first project developing an Android application. After finishing up the Android app, my supervisor and I discussed the possibility of me developing a web app, for users without access to an Android tablet or phone. I created a web version that would automatically scale to either a mobile device or computer. I am currently working on adding a visual aspect such as an expanding and shrinking gif to accompany the tones. The application is cloud based and hosted on Google Cloud. The goal is to have the web application available to select alumni by the end of July 2020 with a full backend implemented to allow for authentication of users and cross-device tracking of specific user behavior. </p>

                <p>During my final quarter at UCSD, myself and a group of 4 others were tasked with creating a prototype for a mobile app that would help out the population during quarantine. We used Figma for the wireframe and prototype and the Adobe creative cloud for images and icons. You can check out the prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/4hXPL5SIPf6mH1GvCi4l7p/DSGN100-A4?node-id=210%3A483&scaling=scale-down">here</a>.</p>

								<p>Another group project that I took part in during my time at UCSD was a data science project. We decided to analyze available health data relating it to city population and population density. You can check out that work <a href="https://github.com/COGS108/FinalProjects-Wi20/blob/master/FinalProject_group083.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

                <p>For my first design centered project, I took part in a team of three to design a wireframe for an application that would simplify the scheduling and information dispersal of rowing teams, from junior to olympic. This was my first time using HTML and CSS and the project helped me get an understanding of how to use the two in conjunction and how to bring me prototypes to life</p>

                <span class="image main"><img src="images/card_games.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></span>
                <p>During the final quarter of my education at UCSD, I was helping a friend learn the basics of object oriented programming. He had almost no experience in programming of any kind. We decided to build a deck of cards for starters to learn the basics of creating objects and methods. We continued by implementing different card games to get him exposure to different data structures and very basic algorithms.
